# Is the Security Blanket for me?
Here are a few of the many reasons to use a Security Blanket.

### It's overwhelming to manage all of your accounts.
Let's be honest, there's a lot to manage. Setting up a Security Blanket helps systematically organize your accounts and help remove some cruft in the process.

### You use the same password (and variations) across all of your accounts.
This is a vulnerable security practice. First, switch to using a password manager, and then start using a Security Blanket for backup. 

### You have written passwords, hints, and backup codes on different pieces of paper throughout your home for your most critical accounts.
That's great, you're already doing the right thing. The Security Blanket brings more organization and portability the system to have more reliability.

### You are the only one that knows how to access all of your accounts, and you want a backup option.
Yes. This is exactly what the Security Blanket is for!

### You would be highly inconvenienced if you suddenly lost your laptop or phone
The Security blanket can restore access in this scenario.

### You know you should have a good backup plan for your accounts, but you just never get around to setting up a system for yourself.
Use the Security Blanket as inspiration to get it done.

### You store all your backup codes as screenshots on your computer, even though you know you shouldn't. 
Delete all those sensitive codes by switching to the Security Blanket

### You've emailed all your most sensitive information to yourself in the case of a disaster.
While well intentioned, this is a major security vulnerability. That email may be compromised, and what happens if you lose access to the email. Use the security blanket.

### You use a Password Manager and store your most sensitive credentials with your favorite cloud service (i.e. Google)
This is a much better position to be in than most people. But you're susceptible to hacks of these services, which while rare, does happen (most recently LastPass). With a security blanket you don't have to worry about credentials being compromised by a 3rd party because it's offline. You just have to trust yourself and your trusted contacts (2nd party).

### You don't want to lose the assets in your crypto wallet.
Don't be on the front page of a newspaper as the person who lost the key to their extremely valuable crypto wallet. Use the security blanket to properly backup that code that **should** always be offline anyway

### You have a backup system in place, but it's too complicated for your trusted contacts.
The Security Blanket system is built with family members in mind, and has been tested to survive the "Mom" Test.
