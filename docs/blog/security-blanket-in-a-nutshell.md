Most of us manage our online accounts using our memory, devices, and sometimes with passwords on scratch paper.

However, you may run into trouble if:

* You forget a password.
* Your device gets damaged.
* You lose your sticky note with that hard-to-remember password that was on the monitor.

Relying on third-party services for account recovery can be slow, and certain things, like crypto wallets, may be lost forever.

# Enter the Security Blanket

It organizes all your account credentials and login methods, ensuring a reliable backup with a small footprint. So now,

* Forget a password? Look it up in the Security Blanket.
* Device trouble? Use your Security Blanket to regain access from another device.
* Can’t find that sticky note? You've upgraded to the Security Blanket, it’s in there.
