### FAQ
#### Why Paper?
Most people already write their passwords down on some notebooks or sticky notes, the Security Blanket provides more structure around the same concept to make it more secure, easier to manage, and easier to share with trusted contacts.

#### What about Password Managers?
Password Managers are great software tools to help manage your digital credentials, and we see them as a complementary tool in the Security Blanket System. However, software has its limits, whether being down or, worst of all, hacked. So we strongly encourage having a backup for the accounts that really matter, that's why we created the Security Blanket!

#### Why Should I Trust the Security Blanket with my credentials?
Short Answer: You don't have to because we never store any of your sensitive data, the whole system is offline! 

We believe the most secure systems are open source, open to audits, inspection, and critique. That's what this site is, an open book into how the system works, so you can verify it for yourself. And remember, there's no software here, no service provider you need to trust, it's a completely offline system. We think it's a solid system, but decide for yourself, and we're always open to suggestions.

#### Why should I pay for this?
Bottom Line: You don't have to.

One of our goals is to level up every individual's security. That's why this entire product is open source, so anyone can learn how to do it for free. We sell the [product](shop.offlinetrust.com) because of the value it creates from convenience, consistency, and a level of accountability.
