# Basic Backup Guide
This is the simplest way to use the Security Blanket, by protecting your most essential credentials in case of some disaster. In Security Blanket [terms](./glossary.md), this means only protecting your TLAs. Reducing the size of the blanket, makes it easier to manage for you and your trusted contacts, especially those that are less technological. So it's a pretty light weight system that works if:
* You have properly accounted for all of your TLAs, so you can subsequently access all of your EAs and RAs after restoring your TLA access.
* Every TLA in the blanket can be restored remotely, without any access to your physical devices. This means backup codes and/or recovery email paths need to be enabled. 

We want the Basic Backup to work in a scenario where:
* The trusted contact has access to the security blanket and nothing else.
* All of your hardware is gone, lost, stolen, inaccessible.


To do this, first make sure you have made your [digital map](./digital-map-template.md) as described in the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md). 

Carefully review the TLAs. Ensure that each of them have a remote restore method that does not rely on any access to a `device` card. Typically, most TLAs have a recovery method that uses "backup codes" for this purpose.

If any `tools` are needed to access a TLA, ensure the `tool` can be accessed via a remote restore method, or provide a recovery method for the TLA that does not depend on the Tool. Again, enabling "backup codes" can suffice.

Count the number of cards you will need per blanket. Most people have less than five TLAs, so this should be pretty quick. 

Your blanket should include all of the TLAs you want to protect and any software tools needed to access TLAs, but no physical `device` or `tool` cards should be included.

>  Most of the blanket's credentials will be in-the-clear, so make sure to keep this blanket safe, especially when giving it to a contact.

Now determine the number of backups you want to make. As described in the [security best practices](./security-best-practices.md):

At a minimum, make a backup blanket for yourself to keep at home. This way you can restore your credentials in case of an emergency. It's also a good practice to have a personal backup copy somewhere off-site, in case of a disaster at home. Lastly, having a trusted contact with a security blanket, can help restore your access when you are away and unable to access your other backups.

Follow the rest of the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) in distributing your blankets to your contacts and you should be good to go!
