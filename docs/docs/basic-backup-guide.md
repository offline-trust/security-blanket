# Basic Backup Guide
**The simplest way to use the Security Blanket to protect your most critical credentials in case of a disaster.**
* Restores access to your `TLAs` under the following scenarios:
    * Your devices are permanently inaccessible: lost, stolen, damaged. You can use the security blanket to log into your `TLAs` from a new device.
    * Your devices are temporarily inaccessible and you don't have access to your security blanket. Your trusted contact can use their copy of your security blanket to help you log into your `TLAs`.
* Blankets are composed of only `TLA` and Software `Tool` cards. So it's a lightweight solution.
* Good for contacts with limited tech knowledge and for digital maps that have a small number of `TLAs` (less than 5). 

## Steps
> We recommend reading the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) first.

1. Create your [digital map](./digital-map-template.md) as described in the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md). Double check that you can access all of your accounts from your `TLAs`, otherwise this will only be a partial backup.

2. Carefully review the `TLAs` and ensure each of them have a [remote restore](./glossary.md) method that does not rely on any access to a `device` card. Typically, most `TLAs` have a recovery method that uses "backup codes" for this purpose.

3. If any `tools` are needed to access a `TLA`, ensure the `tool` can be accessed via a remote restore method, or provide a recovery method for the `TLA` that does not depend on the Tool. Again, enabling "backup codes" can suffice.

4. Count the number of cards you will need per blanket. Most people have less than five `TLAs`, so this should be pretty quick. Your blanket should include all of the `TLAs` you want to protect and any software tools needed to access `TLAs`, but no physical `device` or `tool` cards should be included.

5. Now determine the number of backups you want to make. As described in the [security best practices](./security-best-practices.md):

    At a minimum, make a backup blanket for yourself to keep at home. This way you can restore your credentials in case of an emergency. It's also a good practice to have a personal backup copy somewhere off-site, in case of a disaster at home. Lastly, having a trusted contact with a security blanket, can help restore your access when you are away and unable to access your other backups.

6. Follow the rest of the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) in distributing your blankets to your contacts and you should be good to go!
