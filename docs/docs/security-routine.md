# Security Blanket Routine

After having a security blanket [set up](./getting-started.md), you'll want to follow these suggestions to keep it up-to-date and secure.

1. Review your account passwords, whether due to data breaches or reuse, you'll want to make sure your TLA passwords are as strong as possible, and fix up EAs and then RAs when possible. This is where using a Password Manager helps you detect issues, and make it easy to identify accounts that need updating.

2. Review your account map once a year, if there's a new change (i.e. TLA or EA addition or modification) you'll need to send new cards to your contacts. As long as it's not a TLA you should be able to mail to the contact, without the need for a meet.

3. Remove unused accounts. Reduce your surface area.

4. Regular test (i.e. once a year) to make sure your trusted contact still has access to your account.

5. Review [security best practices](./security-best-practices.md), and switch to more secure practices when possible (follow account prioritization). For example, switching from SMS MFA to Authenticator App MFA.
