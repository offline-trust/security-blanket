# Security Blanket Glossary

## Card Shorthand Notation
**Card Reference** - Cards are referred to by the top-line name and ID provided, `<name>/<id>`. For example, `Phone/1` refers to the first phone listed.

**`@`**- The "@" symbol refers to a card, and is a nice shorthand to describe where a piece of software is located or how to access a credential:
- For example, a TurboTax license may be located on `@Laptop/1`.
- A Yahoo email account card could write out the user ID and password literally (not recommended), or refer to a password manager instead: `ID: @PwdMgr/1` and `PW: @PwdMgr/1`.

**`/`** - The "/" symbol is used sor more specific details of a Card Reference. For example, `Password: @Phone/1/PIN` means use the Phone's PIN as the password for the card in question.

## Other Terms

`Standby Mode`: The contact has the security blanket fully set up and operational, in case any action is required.

`in-the-clear credential`: The literal representation of the credential, i.e. the password text to enter. As opposed to a meta-credential.
