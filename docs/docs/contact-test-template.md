# Initial Test Run

To test your ability to use the Security Blanket, access a TLA and message the owner from that account to prove that you successfully accessed their account.

> Note: Since this is a test run, there may be some devices that are not in your possession, so you may need to coordinate with the owner to complete the test.
* If you cannot complete the test run, let the owner know. 

* If there is a device that you don't have access to, please let the owner know.

* If there is a tool or piece of software you do not know how to use, please checkout [security blanket support page](./support/) for how-to instructions for the most commonly used tools in the community. If it's not there, please reach out to the owner and get more details.

## TLA Access
Most account access is keyed through the primary TLA Account, _________ / __
1. Log into the TLA Account.
2. Send a message to the owner from the TLA (i.e. email them from their own email), "I have successfully used the security blanket to access your account". 

## Operate PwdMgr [Optional]
You will need access to the main Password Manager to access EAs, ensure you can access and use it, PwdMgr/__.

2. Pick a random EA card that uses PwdMgr/1 and log into that account. 

## Clean Up
