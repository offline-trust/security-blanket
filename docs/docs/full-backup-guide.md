**The comprehensive Security Blanket backup strategy to protect your critical credentials, devices, *and* accounts, in case of a disaster.**

    * Contact needs to manage EAs on your behalf. 
* Blankets are composed of `TLA`, `Tool`, `Device`, and `EA` cards.
* Good for backing up access to all EAs that need to be managed if you are unavailable. While possible for a contact to manage EAs with a normal backup and a digital map, this expedites that process and makes it clear which EAs to focus on first.

## Steps
> We recommend reading the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) first.

1. Create your [digital map](./digital-map-template.md) as described in the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md). Double check that you can access all of your accounts from your `TLAs`, otherwise this will only be a partial backup in the case of a remote restore scenario.

2. Carefully review the `TLAs` and ensure each of them have a [remote restore](./glossary.md) method that does not rely on any access to a `device` card. Typically, most `TLAs` have a recovery method that uses "backup codes" for this purpose.

3. If any `tools` are needed to access a `TLA`, ensure the `tool` can be accessed via a remote restore method, or provide a recovery method for the `TLA` that does not depend on the Tool. Again, enabling "backup codes" can suffice.

4. For every `device` card, make sure the descriptor and location are obvious for a trusted contact to be able to locate and operate.

5. Prioritize the list of `EA`s you want to protect. Try to keep it short, as every extra card adds a bit more overhead to the security blanket.

4. Count the number of cards you will need per blanket. Your blanket should include all of the `TLAs` *and `EA`s* you want to protect, all relevant `tools` needed to access `TLAs`, and all of your `devices`.

5. Now determine the number of backups you want to make. As described in the [security best practices](./security-best-practices.md):

    At a minimum, make a backup blanket for yourself to keep at home. This way you can restore your credentials in case of an emergency. It's also a good practice to have a personal backup copy somewhere off-site, in case of a disaster at home. Lastly, having a trusted contact with a security blanket, can help restore your access when you are away and unable to access your other backups.

6. Follow the rest of the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) in distributing your blankets to your contacts and you should be good to go!
