# Security Best Practices
No one's perfect, so try to do as many of these as you can.

## Airgap your critical credentials
Any internet-connected device can be compromised, so the safest thing to do is keep your most valuable credentials off your computer and phone. That's part of the reason why Security Blanket was created, it's too easy to ignore the "write down these backup codes and don't save or screenshot the image" instructions when signing up for a new account. Security Blanket should make it easier to have good system in place and delete those screenshots!

## Use a password manager
Better for passwords, better for keeping track and updating after security breaches, better view into all your assets The password manager should be **local-only**, not dependenet on an internet connection, and avoid storing any sensitive information in the cloud.

## Multi-Factor Authentication Everywhere
Default to using MFA, and use a hardware device > Authenticator Mobile App > Email > SMS. This is the most secure practice that can easily be done now to make your digital security much stronger.

## Do not Repeat Yourself, i.e. DRY
Use the `"@"`notation throughout the security blanket as much as possible. This both helps reduce the chance of mistakes or typos, and makes the writing process faster.

## Most Secure Way To Communicate with Contacts
1. Initially in-person in an offline, private location
2. For Security Blankets, by physical paper (offline)
3. For in-the-clear credentials, opt for in-person on paper, do not mail.
4. For meta-credentials, via mail, or online is probably fine.
5. If you must share credentials in-the-clear, use an encrypted messenger, like Signal, with  disappearing messages. 

## Avoid digital copies of your literal credentials and sensitive information. 
Do Not Take Screenshots or Photos. If you have to, use an encrypted hard drive and encrypt the photos, disable cloud backup, and delete as soon as possible.

## Trust Your Contacts
Having a secure backup system, like Security Blanket, only goes as far as your trust with the people involved. Talk about the importance of keeping this information safe and confidential, make sure they understand the responsibility, the system, and have your best interests in mind.

## Replicate your blanket
To diversify risk, make sure you distribute your blanket to different entities and locations. Don't put everything under your mattress! Aim for 3 blankets: 1 personal backup, 1 to a trusted contact, 1 in a different geography.

At a minimum, make a backup blanket for yourself to keep at home. This way you can restore your credentials in case of an emergency. It's also a good practice to have a personal backup copy somewhere off-site, in case of a disaster at home. Lastly, having a trusted contact with a security blanket, can help restore your access when you are away and unable to access your other backups.

## Keep It Simple
Good security has a learning curve, but a backup system is worthless if your contacts can't figure out how to use it. We've designed The Security Blanket to be simple, but remember to do your part in keeping names and instructions easy to understand for your contacts. If your Mom can't figure it out, it is too complicated.
