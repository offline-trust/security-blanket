# Frequently Asked Questions
### Why paper?
Most people already write their passwords down on some notebooks or sticky notes, the Security Blanket provides more structure around the same concept to make it more secure, easier to manage, and easier to share with trusted contacts.

### Why not just use a password manager?
Password managers are great software tools to help manage your digital credentials, and are highly recommeded in the Security Blanket System. However, they do have their limits in focusing on web accounts, and software services are always at risk of being buggy, down or, worst of all, hacked. So we strongly encourage having a backup for the accounts that really matter, that's why we created the Security Blanket!

### Why should I trust the Security Blanket with my credentials?
Short Answer: You don't have to because we never store any of your sensitive data, the whole system is offline! 

We believe the most secure systems are open source, open to audits, inspection, and critique. That's what this site is, an open book into how the system works, so you can verify it for yourself. And remember, there's no software here, no service provider you need to trust, it's a completely offline system. We think it's a solid system, but decide for yourself, and we're always open to suggestions.

### Why should I pay for this?
