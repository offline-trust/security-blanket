# Frequently Asked Questions
### Why paper?
Paper is a durable and familiar medium. People already write down their passwords in some way. The Security Blanket provides more structure around the same concept to make it more secure, easier to manage, and easier to share with trusted contacts.

Lastly, paper has the advantage of being completely offline, reducing the risk of digital threats.

### Won't paper burn in a fire?
Yes, but so would all your hardware devices. Paper can be stored more easily in fire-resistant containers, and can also be waterproof. The best solution for any disaster scenario is to have an off-site backup location.

### Why not just use a password manager?
Password managers, while excellent for managing digital credentials and highly recommended for the Security Blanket system, have limitations. They primarily cater to web accounts and, like any software, can be prone to bugs, downtime, or hacking risks. Moreover, with the advent of hardware devices that also require secure backups, it's increasingly crucial to have a comprehensive solution. Therefore, we advocate for a reliable backup for your most important accounts and devices, which is precisely the purpose behind developing the Security Blanket.

### Why not just use a hardware device, like Yubikeys, for everything?
Yubikeys have been proven to be the most secure technology for account protection at large companies, and are highly recommended for the Security Blanket system. However, Yubikeys are not universally accepted across all websites, and are incompatible with other hardware devices, like crypto cold wallets. But most importantly, hardware eventually fails, and you need a backup. Therefore, we advocate for a reliable backup for your most important accounts and devices, which is precisely the purpose behind developing the Security Blanket.

### Why should I trust the Security Blanket with my credentials?
Trust isn't required as the Security Blanket is entirely offline and doesn't store your data. 

Our open-source approach allows for transparency and verification. You can inspect and critique the system yourself, ensuring its reliability without needing to rely on any software or service provider. Feedback is always welcome.

### How many cards should I order for my security blanket?
After going through the [digital map exercise](./getting-started.md#map-it), you should have a counted an max number of cards needed. 
> Depending on your backup plan, you may only need a subset of those cards if you do a [basic backup](./basic-backup-guide.md) vs. a [full backup](./full-backup-guide.md). 

Considering potential typos, errors, and future account additions and changes, a good rule of thumb is to order 20% more than your computed number.

### How many Security Blanket backups should I order?
This depends on your backup needs. The Offline Trust ideal is 3, as described in the [security best practices](./security-best-practices.md#replicate-your-blanket):

    At a minimum, make a backup blanket for yourself to keep at home. This way you can restore your credentials in case of an emergency. It's also a good practice to have a personal backup copy somewhere off-site, in case of a disaster at home. Lastly, having a trusted contact with a security blanket, can help restore your access when you are away and unable to access your other backups.

### Can't I just print these out myself?
Of course you can. At Offline Trust, one of our goals is to level up every individual's security. That's why the product is [open source](https://github.com/offline-trust/security-blanket) and freely available for anyone to learn and use. 

While self-printing is an option, purchasing the product from [The Offline Trust Store](https://shop.offlinetrust.com) offers added convenience, consistency, and accountability.
