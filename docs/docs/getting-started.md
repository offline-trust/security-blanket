# Getting Started 
Welcome to making your very own Security Blanket! Although tedious, going through this journey will improve your digital security at each step along the way.

There are 3 major steps in this journey:
1. Organize and map out all of your digital assets and credentials.
2. Write out your security blanket, putting pen to paper.
3. Distribute your security blanket for safe keeping.

Before getting started, make sure to set aside some ample quiet time for yourself in a safe space, so you can work carefully without time pressure or prying eyes. We also recommend reading our [security best practices](./security-best-practices.md).

## 1. Organize Your Digital Life

First things first, you need to figure out what is worth protecting. In this day and age, it's easy for someone to have over 1000 accounts on the internet. But you probably only have a handful of really important accounts (either by value or access). An example of a valuable account is a bank account - real world money! An access (or identity) account is your gateway into most of your accounts, like your Google / Gmail account. Not necessarily valuable in and of itself, but it has access to all of your valuable accounts, we refer to these as **Top-Level-Accounts (TLAs)**. We refer to valuable accounts that you would regret losing access to as **Essential Accounts (EAs)**. All other accounts, are referred to as Regular Accounts (RAs).

>For the Security Blanket, we encourage protecting your TLAs and EAs and leave the rest to a Password Manager.

### Map It
Take the time to review all of your digital accounts now. Warning, this will probably take a few hours. Even longer if you do not use a password manager. You'll be surprised at all of the accounts you've forgotten about, so it's worth the trouble to make sure you're not leaving out anything important. 

1. Write out this **digital map**, in a text editor of your choosing, and keep it handy for the next step. Here's a [template](./digital-map-template.md) for the list of accounts broken down by TLAs and EAs. Remember to consider Financial, Social Networks, Domain Management, and prioritize as you go.

2. For each account listed, log into the account from an incognito window and add write down all devices and authentication tools needed to access each account. You should not write out the literal passwords, but *how* to get the password (i.e. a password manager, or in your head). Familiarize yourself with the [card notation](./glossary.md), and [card overview](./card-overview.md), to maintain a consistent standard in your security blanket.

3. You should now have a complete list of your TLAs, EAs, critical devices, and tools needed to access your digital life. Hopefully, most of them have a similar access pattern (MFA!), but some probably are not up to code. 

> Now is a great time to fix and add extra layers of security to these important accounts.

If done correctly, you can even share your online digital map with your trusted contacts, without risk of compromising its security. Here's an [example map](./digital-map-example.md).

4. That was tedious work, but only you could do it! Count up all of the items in the template, and that's the number of cards you'll need for your security blanket. Make sure you have a extra in case of mistakes, and you're now ready to make your security blanket.

## 2. Making the Security Blanket

### Prerequisites
1. Digital Map, from the previous step.
2. Required devices to access all accounts in the map.
3. Blank set of Security Blanket cards.

### Write It Down
1. With your digital map in hand, it's time to start writing up your security blanket. Here's the recommended order in filling out your cards:
    1. Devices
    2. TLAs
    3. Tools
    4. EAs

The order reduces the amount of literal passwords and IDs you need to write down, since you can refer to previous cards with Pointers using the `@` symbol ([example](./glossary.md)). More information for filling out cards can be found in the [card overview](./card-overview.md). 
> Write legibly, in ink, with clear markers to distinguish similar characters: O vs. 0, Z vs. 2, 7 vs 1 vs l;

>Use `@` Pointers as much as possible. This both helps reduce the chance of mistakes and makes the writing process faster.

2. Once you have all the cards written out, it's time to do a test-run with a blank setup, and verify that you can log into each account using only the instructions from the cards. 

> Correct any errors.

3. Make copies for multiple blankets. And get ready to distribute.

## 3. Distribute your security blanket for safe keeping.

1. Decide on a set of trusted contacts, and make sure you *[trust](./security-best-practices.md#trust-your-contacts)* them. 
2. Confirm with each contact that they are willing to be your security blanket. Go through the responsibilities and your expectations, highlighting the importance of keeping this information safe and confidential, i.e. not taking pictures. Make sure they understand and are willing to be your security blanket.
3. For each confirmed contact
    - Fill out their [contact setup](./contact-instructions.md) and [test instructions](./contact-test-template.md).
    - Meet with your contact in person, and physically hand them your blanket.
    - (Optional) Once secure, run a [test](./contact-test-template.md) to verify that the contact can operate the security blanket.
