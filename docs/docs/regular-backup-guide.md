**The most common Security Blanket backup strategy to protect your critical credentials *and* devices, in case of a disaster.**
* Restores access to your `TLA`s and/or Devices under the following scenarios:
    * All [Basic Backup Scenarios](./basic-backup-guide.md) plus,
    * Lost credentials to your devices, i.e. forgetting your laptop password. Lookup the password in the security blanket.
    * Restoring high value devices, i.e. a Crypto Hardware Wallet backup. Simply lookup the seed phrase in the security blanket.
* Blankets are composed of `TLA`, `Tool`, and `Device` cards.
* Good for contacts with physical access to your devices to access them on your behalf if you are unavailable. Good for self-preservation in spite of human fallibility.

## Steps
> We recommend reading the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) first.

1. Create your [digital map](./digital-map-template.md) as described in the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md). Double check that you can access all of your accounts from your `TLA`s, otherwise this will only be a partial backup in the case of a remote restore scenario.

2. Carefully review the `TLA`s and ensure each of them have a [remote restore](./glossary.md) method that does not rely on any access to a `device` card. Typically, most `TLA`s have a recovery method that uses "backup codes" for this purpose.

3. If any `tools` are needed to access a TLA, ensure the `tool` can be accessed via a remote restore method, or provide a recovery method for the TLA that does not depend on the Tool. Again, enabling "backup codes" can suffice.

4. For every `device` card, make sure the descriptor and location are obvious for a trusted contact to be able to locate and operate.

5. Count the number of cards you will need per blanket. Your blanket should include all of the `TLA`s you want to protect, all relevant `tools` needed to access `TLA`s, and all of your `devices`.

6. Now determine the number of backups you want to make. As described in the [security best practices](./security-best-practices.md):

    At a minimum, make a backup blanket for yourself to keep at home. This way you can restore your credentials in case of an emergency. It's also a good practice to have a personal backup copy somewhere off-site, in case of a disaster at home. Lastly, having a trusted contact with a security blanket, can help restore your access when you are away and unable to access your other backups.

7. Follow the rest of the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) in distributing your blankets to your contacts and you should be good to go!
