# Backup Plan Comparisons

As with all security systems, there's a tradeoff in convenience for security. When determining a backup plan, consider:
* **Backup Strategy**: The number of backup copies. More copies are more resilient to larger disasters, but come at the price of keeping all of those copies up-to-date.
* **Coverage**: What assets the security blanket will protect. For example, all accounts or just `TLAs`? Covering a larger number of accounts and devices will provide faster recovery time, but requires writing a bigger blanket where the likelihood of using any one card becomes less probable.

Compare the different **backup strategies** and **coverages** below to find the right backup plan for you.

### Backup Strategies
* **1 Copy**: A personal security blanket at home.
* **2 Copies**: A personal security blanket at home and off-site backup security blanket (i.e. safety deposit box)
* **2A Copies**: A personal security blanket at home and a trusted contact with a backup security blanket.
* **3 Copies**: A personal security blanket at home, an off-site backup security blanket (i.e. safety deposit box), and a trusted contact with a backup security blanket.

#### Comparison of how different backup strategies* protect you in the following scenarios:

| Scenario | 1 | 2 | 2A | 3 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Forgotten Password | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Damaged Device | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | 
| Natural Disaster destroys home devices and security blanket | No | Yes| Yes | Yes | 
| Device and Personal Security Blanket are temporarily inaccessible (i.e. on vacation) | No | No | Yes | Yes | 
| Family member needs to access your account on your behalf | No | No | Yes | Yes | 

*Assumes a **Regular+** blanket coverage.

### Coverages and their Security Blanket composition.
* **Basic**: `TLAs` and `Tools` cards.
* **Regular**: `TLAs`, `Tools`, and `Devices` cards.
* **Full**: `TLAs`, `Tools`, `Devices`, and `EAs` cards.

#### Comparison of coverage features
| | Basic | Regular | Full | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Restores `TLA` Access | Yes | Yes | Yes | 
| Restores `Device` Access | No | Yes | Yes | 
| Restores `EA` Access Quickly | No | No| Yes |
