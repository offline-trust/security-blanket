# YubiKey

The [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/ease-of-use/) is a hardware key that serves as a physical MFA. It is considered the most secure method for MFA, and is one of the best [security practices](../../security-best-practices.md) to employ. The keys are small and portable, and come in a few [varieties](https://docs.yubico.com/hardware/yubikey/yk-tech-manual/yk5-physical-attributes.html).

## How To Authenticate

To authenticate with a YubiKey, a user simply inserts the key into the USB port and taps the key's button. For mobile devices, the user holds the YubiKey close to the NFC area of the device (the top of the back of most phones) until the MFA token is transmitted.
