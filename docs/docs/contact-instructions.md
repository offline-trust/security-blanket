Hello!

This is a Security Blanket, a paper-based card system to access someone's accounts in the digital world. Please remember that all of this information is highly sensitive, and is **for your eyes only**. 

**Do Not Take a photo, or copy these documents in any way. The best way to keep these secure is to keep everything offline and in a safe place.**

Before getting started, thank you for agreeing to be a trusted contact, it is a big responsibility. Now let's get to it, please do the following:
1. Find a place to store the Security Blanket for safekeeping.
2. Familiarize yourself with the Security Blanket System.
3. Confirm with the owner, that you've received the blanket, know how to use it, and have it safely stored away.
4. Standby Mode

## 1. Store for Safekeeping

Find a safe, secure place to store this highly sensitive data for your access only. The owner trusts you and your judgment in selecting a location.

## 2. The Security Blanket System
There are three types of cards in the blanket. Start by locating the “device” cards and ensure you have access to the physical devices needed to access the accounts. Next, find the “tool” cards, and familiarize yourself with the software needed to access certain accounts. Most accounts require the use of a Password Manager and Multi Factor Authentication (MFA). Check out [security blanket support](./support/) to learn more about any specific tool. 

Finally, you have the “account” cards that detail all of the essential accounts. Every card has a template that describes where to locate the information (Location | Details) and how to access the information (Credentials). You can learn more about all the card sections and notation in the [overview](./card-overview.md) and [glossary](./glossary.md) pages.

Now is a great time to ask questions:
* If there is a device that you don't have access to, please let the owner know.
* If there is a tool or piece of software you do not know how to use, please check out [security blanket support page](./support/) for how-to instructions for the most commonly used tools in the community. If it's not there, please reach out to the owner and get more details.
* If there's anything else you're not sure about, please contact the owner. Better to sort it out now, than in the case of an emergency.

## 3. Confirm Account Access

Run through a [test](./contact-test-template.md) using the Security Blanket to access the owner's accounts, verifying you can operate the blanket.

Once completed, store the security blanket and message the owner to confirm receipt of the blanket and that it's in a safe place.

## 4. Standby Mode

Stand by in case your services are required to access an account, but you're pretty much done. From time to time, the owner may send you more cards to update your blanket, but no other action is needed on your part.
