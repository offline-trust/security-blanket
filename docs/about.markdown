**The Offline Trust is dedicated to improving every individual's digital security through open source education and commercial products.**

We strive to leverage well-known security practices to make people's digital lives safer. The knowledge is out there, our goal is to make it easy to use and understand.

We believe the most secure systems are open source, open to audits, inspection, critique, and improve over time. Our entire methodology and knowledge base is open source, so you can verify it for yourself, but also contribute to make it better.

We take data privacy seriously, and do our best to minimize the amount of data we collect. The good news is that you don't have to trust us because all of our products are offline. There's no service to log into, no database that can be hacked.
