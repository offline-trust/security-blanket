# Google Password Manager

The built-in Google Chrome Password Manager, now called Google Password Manager (GPW), is a great way to manage account credentials. You can find out the latest information at https://passwords.google/, but this guide will show you the basics.

## Location on the Computer

The GPW is built into Chrome, and you can access by going to [chrome://password-manager/passwords](https://passwords.google.com/app) in the URL bar of the browser OR clicking the `Chrome Menu > Settings > Autofill and passwords > Password Manager`

Note: you need to be logged into the Chrome browser with your Google account for this to work.

## Easiest way to use GPW
You don’t need to copy / paste passwords most of the time, because GPW will autofill them for you if the website matches an existing account.

1. Before typing into a username/password box, click into the form field and see if there’s a dropdown list of suggestions.
2. If so, click on it, and GPW will autofill the username and password automatically.

## How to find a password
1. Search for an account by typing into the search field after clicking the the top right corner Search Icon (https://passwords.google.com/app)

4. You can reveal the password by clicking the “eye” icon, which will require entering the device’s password to unlock.

## Additional Features

1. Use the [Checkup](chrome://password-manager/checkup) feature to detect any compromised passwords. This is great for good password hygiene!
